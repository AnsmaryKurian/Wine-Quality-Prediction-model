# Wine-Quality-Prediction-model
# Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to predict wine quality (for both red and white wines) using regression techniques. This model will enable wine producers, sellers, and other stakeholders to efficiently and accurately evaluate wine quality.

# Problem Statement:
The wine industry, a multibillion-dollar market, heavily relies on quality assessment to determine pricing, consumer preferences, and overall market success. Traditionally, wine quality has been assessed by human experts through sensory analysis. While valuable, this method is inherently subjective, time-intensive, and expensive.An objective, consistent, and scalable approach to predicting wine quality based on its chemical properties can bring transparency and efficiency to the evaluation process. Such a solution benefits producers, sellers, and consumers by ensuring reliable quality assessments while reducing costs and improving decision-making.

# Objective:
Create the most accurate wine quality prediction model using machine learning techniques to assist stakeholders in quality assessment and improvement.

# Data Description:

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Wine Quality Dataset
Features:
Input Variables:
Fixed Acidity
Volatile Acidity

Residual Sugar
Chlorides
Free Sulfur Dioxide
Total Sulfur Dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Wine Type (0 = White, 1 = Red, combined data for red and white wines)

# Conclusion:
This machine learning model predicts wine quality based on its chemical properties (e.g., pH, citric acid, alcohol content). The performance of the model depends on feature selection, data preprocessing, and the algorithms applied.Among the models tested, Random Forest Regression delivered the best results, achieving the highest accuracy and RÂ² score. This data-driven approach allows wine producers and stakeholders to:
Enhance quality control processes.
Reduce costs associated with traditional quality assessment.
Improve customer satisfaction by ensuring consistent wine quality.
